# Getting Started

## Install dependencies

```bash
yarn start

npx pod-install
```

## Step 2: Start bundler

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Run build

### iOS
Open ``/ios/Test0510.xcworkspace`` in Xcode & run project on device or simulator

### Android
Open ``/android`` folder in Android Studio and build project for already created emulator or real device
